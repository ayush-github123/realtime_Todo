# Real-Time Todo Application

This project is a real-time to-do application built using Django, Django Channels, and WebSockets. It allows users to join a specific room to add and view tasks in real-time. The tasks are displayed as soon as they are added, with the newest tasks appearing at the top.

## Features

- **Real-Time Task Updates**: Users can add tasks that will be immediately visible to others in the same room.
- **Task List**: The tasks are displayed in the order they are added, with the newest tasks appearing at the top.
- **Join Room**: Users can join a room by entering a room number.
- **Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: A Python web framework used for building the backend.
- **Django Channels**: A Django extension to handle WebSockets for real-time communication.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Used for styling the frontend.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the WebSocket communication and dynamic updates to the DOM.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django 4.x
- Django Channels 4.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayush-github123/realtime_todo.git
    cd realtime_todo
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
    venv\scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Apply the migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. Run the development server using daphne:

    ```bash
    daphne -b 127.0.0.1 -p 8000 realtime_todo.asgi:application
    ```

6. Open the app in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## How It Works

### WebSocket Communication
- The application uses WebSockets to send and receive tasks in real-time. When a user adds a task, it is sent to the WebSocket server and broadcasted to all users in the same room.
- Tasks are displayed in the order they are received, with the newest tasks appearing at the top.

### Room Functionality
- Users can join a room by entering a room number. Each room is isolated, meaning tasks from different rooms will not be mixed.
- Once a user joins a room, they can send tasks that will appear for all users in that room in real-time.

### Frontend
- The frontend is built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.
- JavaScript is responsible for opening the WebSocket connection, sending tasks to the server, and dynamically updating the task list.

## Errors Encountered & How They Were Solved

### 1. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - **Problem**: Initially, the WebSocket connection was not being established properly.
   - **Solution**: I added proper error handling for the WebSocket connection, including checks for already open connections and closing them before creating a new connection. This resolved the connection issue.

### 2. **Past Tasks Showing in Reverse Order**
   - **Problem**: When past tasks were received from the WebSocket server, they were displayed in reverse order (newest task at the top).
   - **Solution**: To fix this, I reversed the order of past tasks when they were inserted into the DOM. This ensured that older tasks appeared first, maintaining the correct task order.

### 3. **Tasks Not Being Added to the Top**
   - **Problem**: When a new task was added, it appeared at the bottom of the task list, instead of the top.
   - **Solution**: I used `insertBefore()` in JavaScript to insert new tasks at the top of the task list.

### 4. **Loading Message Not Being Removed**
   - **Problem**: The loading message for the tasks was not being hidden after tasks were successfully loaded.
   - **Solution**: I ensured that the loading message was hidden once tasks started arriving by setting `loadingMessage.style.display = "none"` when tasks were received.

### 5. **Room Joining Error**
   - **Problem**: There was no validation to check if the user entered an empty room number, causing the WebSocket connection to fail.
   - **Solution**: I added a check to validate the room number before attempting to join the room and provided an alert if the input was empty.

## Next Steps

- **Editing Tasks**: Currently, there is no functionality to edit existing tasks. I plan to implement this feature in a future update, allowing users to click on a task to edit its content.
  
- **Deleting Tasks**: Deleting tasks is also not implemented yet. This feature will allow users to remove tasks from the list after they have completed them.

- **Styling Improvements**: Additional frontend styling improvements will be made to enhance the user interface and user experience.
